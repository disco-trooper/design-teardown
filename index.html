              <code>background-repeat</code> in CSS defines if and how a
              <code>background-image</code> property will repeat. Chris Coyier
              <span class="link">summarized the values for the property</span>.
              Be sure to give <code>background-repeat: round</code> a try to
              repeat an image without clipping.
